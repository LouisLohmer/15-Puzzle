# 15-Puzzle

## About the Project
The **15-Puzzle** is a game consisting of 15 squares numbered from 1 to 15 and **an empty square in which the direct horizontally or vertically neighbor square/tile can be moved into**. The goal is to move the tiles into the **correct order from top to bottom**, so each number is ordered correctly. By hovering over the tiles, you can see which can be moved and which cant. **Non-moveable tiles will stay blue, while moveable tiles turn purple and smaller**. Keep in mind that text in the frontend is written in german, since i'am a german developer.

## Solve puzzle automatically to see the correct order
If you want to see the correct order in which the puzzle should be in, just press the left button that's labeled with "Kacheln sortieren".

## Shuffle puzzle
The website will shuffle the puzzle randomly and automatically, if it's loaded. However, by pressing the right button that's labeled with "Neues Spiel", you can also shuffle it again and start a new game
