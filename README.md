# 15-Puzzle
This repo contains the selfmade and modern version of the so called "15-Puzzle", a game consisting of 15 squares numbered from 1 to 15 and an empty square in which the direct horizontally or vertically square can be moved into. The goal is to move the tiles into the correct order from top to bottom, so each number is ordered correctly.
